# class 5 â€” rock paper scissors!

here's the rock paper scissors app we made in class. you should be able to run this example with Live Server or otherwise just serve the `index.html` file

## practice 

if you feel up for it, there are some improvements to be made! you can clone this repo and try a couple things:

- fix the CPU's container not being the same height as the player's
- add a score tracker to keep track of the player's and CPU's scores 
- make a sound play when the round concludes
- make it prettier!
